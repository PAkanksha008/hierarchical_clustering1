# hierarchical_clustering1
Project title: Analysis and prediction of small custerms.csv file of mall market called as phonix small, find out on the basis of clients requriments of dendogram using scipy graphics library with the help of "scipy.cluster.hierarchy", to ace the No of linkage of clustering to predict
## Problem Statement :
### The american market clients as per the rate of GDP of 2011 found as highest no of growth in there business market
### As a DataScience engineer find out which hierarcy cluster give maximum  linkage in upcomming future.
##Task:1
### with the help of import the libraries and import the Dataset
##Task:2
###using the dendogram tom find the optimal number of clusters
##Task:3
###create a hirarchal model and visualize the cluster with help of matplotlib.

 ##conclusion:
### Accoriding to the model building as a enginner my prediction cluster no 3 hightest no of linkage
